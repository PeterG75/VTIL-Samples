# VTIL-Samples

This repo contains a number of samples to get you started with VTILs API.

## Building
Open the project as folder in Visual Studio 2019 and let it generate the CMake files. Once the generation has ended you can launch the examples.  
Alternatively, you can configure this project on the command line:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ..
```

You can now open the resulting `VTIL-Samples.sln` solution file in Visual Studio.

## Examples
